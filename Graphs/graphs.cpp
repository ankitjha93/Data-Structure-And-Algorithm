1. graph contains nodes and edges
2.There are two types of graph directed and undirected graphs
3.In directed graph all the edges are directed,
4.Cycles in a graph ---- start from a node & end at that node.
5.Path -- Contain a lot of nodes and each of them are reacheable
6.Degrees in Graph -- no. of nodes pass through that particular node. Property -- Total degree of a graph = 2 * edges.
7. In directed Graph - Indegree(node) and OutDegree(node) means no. of nodes toward that node and away from that node.
8. Edge Weight -- weight associated to that particular edge...
